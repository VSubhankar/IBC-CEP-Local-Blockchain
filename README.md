# THIS IS A MODIFIED CODE , 
## WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY CLONED FROM https://github.com/IBC-Media/CEP-Assignment

## Club Members Pallet has a functionality to form a special isolated group of users called club, These Club members are restricted to perform transactions only within the club.
### AS PER QUESTION I HAVE ADDED NEW FUNCTION NAMED add_member_if_less_than_two THAT ADDS ANY USER TO CLUB IF EXISTING NUMBER OF CLUBMEMBERS ARE LESS THAN 2
